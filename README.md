# VEIL: Privacy-Preserving Loyalty Platform
A Web3 loyalty platform enabling customers to prove product ownership attributes without revealing specific products, powered by zero-knowledge proofs.
Project Overview
PrivatePass leverages zero-knowledge cryptography to bridge the gap between brand loyalty and customer privacy. Customers collect digital product passports in their wallet and generate cryptographic proofs that verify eligibility for rewards, events, and services without exposing their specific purchase history.
Core Features

Private Verification: Generate ZK proofs that verify ownership attributes without revealing specific products
Digital Passport Collection: Import and manage digital proof of ownership for products
Attribute-Based Access: Access exclusive rewards based on collection attributes
Cross-Brand Opportunities: Enable privacy-preserving loyalty across multiple brands

## Technology Stack

- **ZK Technology:** [Aztec's zkDSL Noir / Brevis ZK Coprocessor / Aleo]
- **Frontend**: React, Web3 integration, wallet connectivity
- **Smart Contracts:** ZK verification logic, reward management

## Development Guidelines
### Repository Structure

### Branch Management
We follow the GitHub Flow branching strategy to maintain organization and quality:

1. Main Branch: Production-ready code only. Protected from direct pushes.
2. Feature Branches: For new features or changes
- Naming convention: feature/brief-description
- Example: feature/wallet-connection, feature/zk-proof-generation

3. Bug Fix Branches: For fixing bugs
- Naming convention: fix/brief-description
- Example: fix/verification-error

4. Documentation Branches: For documentation changes
- Naming convention: docs/brief-description
- Example: docs/readme-update


5. Working with Branches:
- Create branch from latest main: git checkout -b feature/your-feature main
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Pull/rebase from main regularly to minimize merge conflicts
- Push to remote branch: git push -u origin feature/your-feature
- Create Pull Request to merge into main
